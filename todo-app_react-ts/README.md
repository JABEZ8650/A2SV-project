## Simple To-Do List Web Application

This To-Do List web app is built using React.js and TypeScript. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, deleting, and editing them. Users can also choose to save or discard changes while editing tasks. The app utilizes local storage, ensuring that tasks persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed. When a task is added, it is immediately stored in local storage, making it available even after the page is reloaded.

### Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list with a single click.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks, with options to save or cancel changes.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in local storage, ensuring they remain even after a browser refresh or closure.
